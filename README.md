# jfx-candy-store
In this repos is a JFX project simulating a candy store. There are button functions to buy candy (add them to bag), and remove candy from the bag. In the menu are functions to check all candy purchased in the bag, and to check out and reset.

# How does it work?
The user is greeted to a table that contains some candy to buy with the prices, names, and quantity available listed. Upon buying, the candy is removed when the quantity reaches 0, and upon adding candy back, sum is incremented if the candy is already in the shop. Check out an reset resets the user's candy bag as empty and shop with the original items placed.
